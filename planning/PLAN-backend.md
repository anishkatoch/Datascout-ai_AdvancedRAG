# Backend Plan — Python / FastAPI

---

## Phase 1 — uv + Docker Foundation ✅ Done

- `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` replace `requirements.txt`
- `Dockerfile` — Python 3.13-slim + uv, non-root user (UID 1000) for HF Spaces
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` set to `/app/.playwright-browsers` so non-root user can access it
- Anyone clones and runs — no manual install needed

---

## Phase 2 — FastAPI Backend ✅ Done

### Folder Structure
```
app/
├── main.py              # FastAPI app, mounts routers + static files
├── routers/
│   ├── upload.py        # POST /upload/files, /upload/url, /upload/api
│   └── chat.py          # POST /chat
├── services/

```

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /health             → { status: "ok" }
POST /upload/files       → SSE stream — parses files, chunks, embeds, returns session_id
POST /upload/url         → SSE stream — scrapes URL, chunks, embeds, returns session_id
POST /upload/api         → JSON — fetches API endpoint, chunks, embeds, returns session_id
POST /chat/              → { session_id, question } → { answer, citations, elapsed_ms }
GET  /                   → serves frontend (index.html)
```

### RAG Pipeline
```
1. INGESTION          2. STORING           3. RETRIEVAL         4. LLM ANSWER
   Files / URLs /        ChromaDB (free)      MMR search           Groq llama-3.3-70b
   APIs parsed &         pgvector             diverse, non-        answers from
   chunked (1000         (Supabase)           redundant chunks     retrieved context
   chars, 200 overlap)   per session_id
```

### Ingestion — Supported Sources
| Source | How | Library |
|---|---|---|
| PDF, DOCX, TXT | Parse with page metadata | LiteParse (Rust) |
| URL | Scrape content | Crawl4AI (primary) → Playwright (fallback) |
| API endpoint | HTTP GET + JSON flatten | httpx |

### LLM — Groq (Free)
- Model: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (default, configurable via `GROQ_MODEL`)
- Free tier: 14,400 requests/day, 6,000 tokens/minute
- Switch model anytime via `.env` — no code change needed

### Embeddings — Dual Provider
| Provider | Model | Dims | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BGE (default)** | BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 | 1024 | Free (HF Inference API) |
| OpenAI (fallback) | text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Paid |

Switch via `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=bge` or `openai` in `.env`.

### Vector Store — Dual Provider
| Store | When used | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| **ChromaDB** | Default / HF Spaces / no DB creds | Local disk (`./chroma_data/`) |
| pgvector (Supabase) | When `DB_HOST` is set | Cloud PostgreSQL |

Auto-fallback: tries pgvector first, falls back to ChromaDB if connection fails.

### Retrieval — MMR
Tunable via `.env`:
```env
RETRIEVAL_K=3          # chunks returned to LLM
RETRIEVAL_FETCH_K=10   # candidate pool size (must be >= K)
RETRIEVAL_LAMBDA=0.7   # 1.0=similarity, 0.0=diversity, 0.7=balanced
```

---

## Phase 3 — SSE Streaming Upload ✅ Done

File and URL uploads stream real-time progress to the frontend via Server-Sent Events:
- `step start` → shows step starting with live timer
- `step done` → marks step complete with elapsed time
- `complete` → returns `session_id`, total time
- `error` → surfaces failure reason

---

## Phase 4 — Page Tracking + Confidence ✅ Done

Each chunk stored in the vector store carries:
```json
{
  "source": "report.pdf",
  "chunk_index": 7,
  "page_number": 3,
  "confidence": 0.9812
}
```

How it works:
- `parse_file()` returns `(full_text, page_spans)` — list of `{page_number, start, end, confidence}`
- `confidence` = avg OCR confidence across all text items on that page (from LiteParse)
- `chunk_text_with_offsets()` returns chunks with their `start_index` in the full text
- `find_page(start_index, page_spans)` maps each chunk to its page
- Citations in chat responses include `page_number` and `confidence`

---

## Phase 5 — Smart Deduplication 📋 Planned

> Hash-based re-embed is implemented in `upload.py`. TF-IDF 3-point check + confirmation gate are still planned.

Avoid re-creating embeddings when the same file is uploaded again. Saves processing time and cost.

### Privacy Isolation — X-Client-Token
Every browser generates a UUID on first page load and stores it in `localStorage`.
Sent as `X-Client-Token` header on every upload request.
All dedup lookups are scoped to this token — different browsers never share cached data.

```javascript
// chat.js — on page load
if (!localStorage.getItem('client_token')) {
    localStorage.setItem('client_token', crypto.randomUUID())
}

// sent with every upload
fetch('/upload/files', {
    headers: { 'X-Client-Token': localStorage.getItem('client_token') },
    body: form
})
```

Without this: User A uploads `report.pdf` → User B uploads same filename → hits User A's cache → privacy breach.
With this: every browser is completely isolated.

---

### What gets stored in `Document` table

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `client_token` | Browser UUID — isolates dedup per browser, prevents privacy leaks |
| `filename` | Normalized to lowercase — case-insensitive matching |
| `file_size` | Size in bytes |
| `content_hash` | SHA256 of file bytes — bulletproof exact match |
| `first_chunk` | First 500 chars of parsed text |
| `middle_chunk` | Middle 500 chars of parsed text |
| `last_chunk` | Last 500 chars of parsed text |
| `avg_confidence` | Avg OCR confidence from LiteParse — sets dynamic TF-IDF threshold |
| `chunks_stored` | Total chunks written to vector store — shown in confirmation card |
| `session_id` | Reuse this if duplicate detected |
| `status` | `"pending"` → `"complete"` → `"failed"` — never deleted, shown to user |
| `uploaded_at` | Timestamp — shown as "uploaded 2 hours ago" in confirmation card |

**DB constraints:**
- Unique constraint on `(client_token, content_hash)` — prevents race condition duplicates
- Index on `client_token` — fast lookup for TF-IDF corpus queries

**Status values:**
- `pending` — processing in progress
- `complete` — fully processed, safe to reuse
- `failed` — processing failed, shown to user as failed upload, never reused

---

### Deduplication Rules (in order)

**Rule 1 — Same filename + same file size + same SHA256 hash → Reuse immediately**
- Compute SHA256 of file bytes (~5ms, negligible)
- Query `Document` table scoped to `client_token`: match on `filename` + `file_size` + `content_hash`
- If found → reuse existing `session_id`, skip all parsing/chunking/embedding
- SHA256 protects against:
  - Same name + size but content changed (typo fix, metadata update)
  - Corrupted original upload
  - Two files coincidentally same name + size

**Rule 2 — Same filename + different size or different hash → Process fresh**
- Same name but content changed → must reprocess
- Insert new entry in `Document` table

**Rule 3 — Different filename + file < 2MB → Process fresh**
- Small file, dedup overhead not worth it
- Just process normally

**Rule 4 — Different filename + file ≥ 2MB → TF-IDF on 3 points**
- Extract first + middle + last 500 chars from newly parsed text
- Compare all 3 against stored chunks in `Document` table (scoped to `client_token`) using TF-IDF
- Dynamic threshold based on `avg_confidence`:
  - `avg_confidence < 0.85` → scanned/OCR doc → threshold = **0.90**
  - `avg_confidence ≥ 0.85` → native PDF → threshold = **0.95**
- All 3 points must exceed threshold → reuse `session_id`
- Any point below threshold → process fresh
- Checking 3 points (not just first+last) prevents false positives from boilerplate headers/footers

**Rule 5 — Document table unreachable → Skip dedup, process fresh**
- Entire dedup logic wrapped in `try/except`
- If DB down or ChromaDB fallback active → log warning → skip dedup → process normally
- Upload never crashes because of dedup failure

**Why TF-IDF not vector similarity:**
- No embedding API call → free + ~100ms
- Dedup needs word-level match, not semantic match
- Vector similarity is for retrieval — overkill and costly here

---

### Complete Decision Flow

```
Upload received + X-Client-Token
        ↓
Normalize filename to lowercase
        ↓
Compute SHA256 hash (~5ms)
        ↓
try:
    Query Document table (scoped to client_token, status="complete")
            ↓
    Same filename + same size + same hash?
        YES →  Verify vector collection still exists + has vectors
                    EXISTS  → ⚡ Reuse immediately (Rule 1)
                    MISSING → process fresh, update existing entry (Rule 1b)
        NO  ↓
    Same filename + different size or hash?
        YES → ⚙ Process fresh (Rule 2)
        NO  ↓
    File < 2MB?
        YES → ⚙ Process fresh (Rule 3)
        NO  ↓
    len(parsed_text) < 1500 chars?
        YES → ⚙ Process fresh — too short for reliable TF-IDF (Rule 4 edge case)
        NO  ↓
    Extract first + middle + last 500 chars
    TF-IDF against last 50 docs (scoped to client_token)
    avg_confidence < 0.85 → threshold=0.90 (OCR doc)
    avg_confidence ≥ 0.85 → threshold=0.95 (native PDF)
    All 3 scores > threshold →  Verify collection exists
                                    EXISTS  → ✅ Reuse (Rule 4a)
                                    MISSING → process fresh (Rule 4b)
    Any score ≤ threshold   → ⚙ Process fresh (Rule 4c)
except (DB down, any error):
    → ⚠ Log warning → skip dedup → process fresh (Rule 5)

--- After processing fresh ---
Insert Document entry with status="pending"
        ↓
Parse → Chunk → Embed → Write to vector store
        ↓
SUCCESS → set status="complete"
FAILURE → leave status="pending" (dedup will never reuse it)

--- Multi-file batch ---
Create ONE master session_id for the batch
For each file:
    cached → copy vectors into master session
    new    → write vectors into master session
Return master session_id to frontend
```

---

### Failure Cases & Fixes

**🔴 Critical — wrong answers or app breaks**

| Case | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Vector store write fails after Document entry created | Dedup reuses session with no vectors → empty answers | `status` field — only reuse `status="complete"` entries. On failure → set `status="failed"`, show as failed in UI |
| Server restart clears ChromaDB but Document table keeps entry | Dedup reuses dead session_id → chat fails | Before reusing, verify collection exists + has vectors. If missing → process fresh → insert new entry |
| Partial upload / network drop | Partial embeddings → incomplete answers | Only set `status="complete"` after full vector store write. If fails → set `status="failed"` |
| Multi-file batch session confusion | 3 files → 3 different session_ids → chat only sees 1 file | ONE master session_id per batch. Copy cached vectors + write new vectors into master session |
| Confirmation gate — user walks away | SSE hangs forever, server holds open connection | 60s timeout on confirmation gate → auto-defaults to "process fresh" if no response |

**🟡 Medium — user frustrated**

| Case | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Race condition — double click or two tabs | Both pass dedup → duplicate embeddings → weird answers | DB unique constraint on `(client_token, content_hash)`. First insert wins, second = cache hit |
| TF-IDF slow with 100+ uploads | Scans all docs → slow | Limit to last 50 docs per `client_token`. Index on `client_token` |
| File too short for 3-point check | Text < 1500 chars → first/middle/last overlap → unreliable | If `len(text) < 1500` → skip TF-IDF → use hash only |
| SSE can't resume after user clicks confirm | SSE is one-way, confirm comes via separate POST | `asyncio.Event()` — dedup holds event, `/upload/confirm` triggers it, SSE stream resumes |
| User clicks "Reprocess Fresh" | What happens to old entry? | Do nothing to old entry — just insert a new entry + process fresh. Old entry stays as historical record |
| Stale `status="pending"` entries | Failed uploads leave dead rows forever | Never delete — mark as `status="failed"`. Show failed uploads to user so they know |
| URL uploaded twice | Duplicate embeddings for same URL | Hash the URL string → same dedup rules as files (minus TF-IDF size check) |
| API endpoint called twice | Duplicate embeddings | Hash `url + headers` → same dedup rules |
| `/upload/confirm` spam | Anyone can spam endpoint | Tie confirm to a one-time token per upload — token expires after use or 60s |
| Multi-file batch mixed dedup | file1 needs confirm, file2 is new — do we pause all? | Show confirmations one at a time. Process new files in parallel while waiting for user decisions |

**🟢 Minor — inefficient but not harmful**

| Case | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Incognito / localStorage cleared | New token → re-processes everything | Acceptable — just slower, answers still correct |
| Filename case sensitivity | `Report.pdf` vs `report.pdf` → misses | Normalize filename to lowercase before lookup |
| Unicode in filename | `résumé.pdf` vs `resume.pdf` → misses | Acceptable — just re-processes |
| SHA256 collision | Wrong reuse | Ignore — probability 1 in 2^256 |

### Logs at every step
```
[DEDUP] report.pdf (0.4MB) → hash match, reusing session=abc-123
[DEDUP] report.pdf (0.4MB) → hash mismatch, processing fresh
[DEDUP] invoice.pdf (1.2MB) → different filename, below 2MB threshold, processing fresh
[DEDUP] manual.pdf (5MB) → running TF-IDF (3-point), confidence=0.91, threshold=0.95
[DEDUP] manual.pdf (5MB) → scores=[0.97, 0.96, 0.98], reusing session=abc-123
[DEDUP] manual.pdf (5MB) → scores=[0.97, 0.61, 0.98], processing fresh
[DEDUP] DB unreachable → skipping dedup, processing fresh
```

### User Confirmation Gate

Before reusing ANY existing embeddings, ask the user first — safety net that catches all dedup failures.
Only shown when reusing. New files go straight through — no interruption.

**SSE event sent to frontend when match found:**
```json
{
  "type": "dedup_confirm",
  "filename": "report.pdf",
  "uploaded_ago": "2 hours ago",
  "file_size": "1.2 MB",
  "chunks_stored": 42,
  "reason": "same_hash" | "tfidf_match"
}
```

**Frontend shows confirmation card:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Existing embeddings found for report.pdf      │
│                                                  │
│  Uploaded: 2 hours ago                           │
│  Size: 1.2 MB · 42 chunks stored                │
│  Reason: identical file detected                 │
│                                                  │
│  [⚡ Use Existing]      [🔄 Reprocess Fresh]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**User clicks "Use Existing"** → frontend sends `POST /upload/confirm` with `{ session_id, action: "reuse" }`
**User clicks "Reprocess Fresh"** → frontend sends `POST /upload/confirm` with `{ session_id, action: "reprocess" }`

**Why this is the ultimate safety net:**
- Catches ALL dedup wrong decisions before they affect the user
- User sees exactly when + why embeddings are being reused
- One click to override — zero frustration

---

### Performance & Code Quality Rules

**No duplicate code — single source of truth:**
- All dedup logic lives ONLY in `app/services/dedup.py` — routers never contain dedup logic
- All SSE event formatting lives ONLY in one `sse()` helper — never duplicated
- All vector store operations go through `get_vector_store()` — no direct ChromaDB/pgvector calls in routers

**Latency optimizations:**
- SHA256 computed in memory — no disk write (~5ms)
- DB query uses indexed columns only (`client_token`, `content_hash`) — sub-millisecond lookup
- TF-IDF runs only when needed (Rule 4) — not on every upload
- TF-IDF limited to last 50 docs — O(50) not O(n)
- Collection verification is a single COUNT query — not a full scan
- `status="pending"` insert uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` — race condition handled at DB level, no extra round trip
- All dedup steps run before any file parsing — fail fast before expensive operations

**Async everywhere:**
- All DB queries in dedup are `async` — never blocks FastAPI event loop
- TF-IDF computation runs in `asyncio.to_thread()` — CPU-bound, must not block event loop
- Vector copy for batch reuse runs async — doesn't delay SSE stream

---

### SSE Events (user sees in UI)

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `dedup_confirm` | Match found — waiting for user decision |
| `⚙ New file detected — processing fresh` | No match found |
| `⚠ Dedup check skipped — processing fresh` | DB unreachable |

---

### File Upload Limits Per Conversation

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Max files per session | 5 |
| Total size of all files combined | < 40MB |
| Reset | New chat → new session → limits reset completely |

**One rule — total combined size must be under 40MB regardless of how many files:**
```
User adds files (1 file or 5 files)
        ↓
Total combined size ≥ 40MB?
    YES → ❌ "Total upload size must be under 40MB. Start a new chat to upload more."
    NO  → ✅ Allow upload
```

**Enforced in both frontend and backend** — never trust frontend alone.

**UI shows running total as user adds files:**
```
3 files · 24.5 MB of 40 MB
```

**`.env` config:**
```env
MAX_FILES_PER_SESSION=5
MAX_SESSION_SIZE_MB=40
```

### Files to change

| File | What changes |
|---|---|
| `app/models/db.py` | Add all new fields + `uploaded_at`, `chunks_stored`, `status` to `Document` table. Unique constraint on `(client_token, content_hash)`. Index on `client_token` |
| `app/models/schemas.py` | Add `ConfirmRequest(session_id, action: "reuse" \| "reprocess", confirm_token)` and `ConfirmResponse` |
| `app/services/dedup.py` | New file — ALL dedup logic: hash, collection verify, TF-IDF 3-point, vector merge, one-time confirm token, asyncio.Event for SSE resume. Nothing else contains dedup logic |
| `app/routers/upload.py` | Read `X-Client-Token` header. Create master session_id per batch. Call `dedup.check()`. Pause SSE on `dedup_confirm`, resume on asyncio.Event. Add `POST /upload/confirm`. URL + API dedup |
| `app/static/chat.js` | Generate + store `client_token` in localStorage. Send as header. Render confirmation card on `dedup_confirm`. Auto-timeout card after 60s. Send confirm/reprocess. Show warning at 5 file limit. Show `status="failed"` entries |
| `alembic/versions/` | New migration for all new columns + constraints |
| `env.example` | Add `DEDUP_SIZE_THRESHOLD_MB=2`, update `MAX_FILES_PER_SESSION=5` |

### One Rule: No Logic in Routers
Routers only:
1. Read request → call service → stream SSE → return response
All business logic (dedup, parsing, chunking, embedding) stays in `app/services/`

---

## Phase 6 — Persistence + Speed 🔜 Next

### 6a — Supabase Free Tier (Persistent Sessions)
- Connect Supabase free PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Sessions survive server restarts
- Set `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` in HF Spaces secrets
- No code change needed — already supported

### 6b — Faster PDF Extraction
Options (in order of impact):
1. **Skip OCR for native PDFs** — try `ocr_enabled=False` first, fall back only for scanned docs (biggest speedup)
2. **Run parsing off event loop** — wrap `_parser.parse()` in `asyncio.to_thread()` (stops blocking FastAPI)
3. **Parallel pages** — pass `num_workers=N` to `LiteParse()` constructor

### 6c — Session History ✅ Done
- Per-session in-memory history (`_history_store` dict, threadsafe with `_history_lock`)
- Last 10 turns kept per session (20 messages total)
- Passed to intent check AND answer nodes — follow-up replies like "yup" work correctly
- Appended after every answer, cleared on session reset

---

## Phase 7 — LangGraph RAG Pipeline (Intent + HyDE + Query Rewriting + Neo4j) ✅ Done

### Problems Being Solved
1. **Small talk hits retrieval unnecessarily** — "hi", "how are you" triggers MMR search = wasted tokens
2. **Vague questions get bad context** — "what is in this doc" returns 3 random chunks → wrong/partial summary
3. **Mixed messages not handled** — "how are you, tell me the risks" needs routing, not just retrieval
4. **Vector search misses relationships** — "what happens if Acme breaches?" needs entity traversal, not chunk similarity

```

---

### Intent Check (always on, outside graph)
```
Prompt: "Does this message ask about uploaded documents? Answer YES or NO only.
Message: {question}"
```
- Single token response — ~200ms, negligible tokens
- Handles mixed messages: "hi, tell me the risks" → YES
- NO → direct LLM answer, never enters LangGraph
- YES → check Advanced Mode toggle → enter correct LangGraph path

---

### Simple Path — Advanced Mode OFF

**Node 1 — HyDE**
```
Generate a hypothetical answer to the question.
Question: "what is in this NDA"
→ "This NDA covers confidentiality obligations between two parties,
   defines confidential information, sets a 2-year term..."
→ Use this hypothetical answer as the search query
```
- HyDE IS the query — no separate rewriting needed
- Hypothetical answer shape matches real chunk shape → better MMR results

**Node 2 — MMR Retrieval (vector only)**
- Run MMR with HyDE query → top k chunks
- Returns: chunks with source, page, chunk_index, confidence

**Node 3 — LLM Answer**
```
You are a helpful assistant analyzing uploaded documents.

Context:
{vector_context}

- If asked to summarize → summarize everything in the context
- If asked something specific → answer from context
- If asked for opinion/advice → reason from context and give your view
- If context has no relevant info → say so clearly

Question: {question}
```

---

### Advanced Path — Advanced Mode ON

**Node 1 — Query Rewriting**
```
Rewrite this question into 3 different search queries.
Question: "what are the risks in this NDA"
→ "NDA risk clauses liability obligations"
→ "confidentiality agreement potential issues penalties"
→ "legal risks unlimited liability breach consequences"
```
- 3 variants cover different angles of the same question
- No HyDE here — graph DB handles the relationship/entity side

**Node 2 — Parallel Retrieval (Vector + Neo4j Graph)**

*Vector side:*
- Run MMR for each of 3 query variants independently
- Merge all results, deduplicate by chunk content
- Returns: text chunks with source, page, chunk_index, confidence

*Neo4j Graph side:*
- Built during ingestion — entities + relationships extracted from chunks
- At query time: traverse graph for entities mentioned in question
```
"Acme" → Party node
       → obligated-to → [protect Confidential Information]
       → breach → Consequence node → [penalty, termination]
```
- Returns: entity paths + related facts as structured text

### Neo4j Graph DB — Ingestion Side
During file upload, after chunking, run entity extraction per chunk:
```
Text chunk → LLM extracts:
  Entities: [Acme Corp, Beta Inc, Confidential Information, 2 years]
  Relations: [Acme Corp]  --signs-->         [NDA]
             [Acme Corp]  --obligated-to-->   [protect Confidential Information]
             [Beta Inc]   --receives-->        [Confidential Information]
             [NDA]        --expires-->         [2 years]
             [Breach]     --results-in-->      [Termination + Penalty]
```
Store in **Neo4j AuraDB free tier** — persistent, survives server restarts.

### What Each Question Gets
| Question | Intent | Mode | Path | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "hi" | NO | any | Direct LLM | Friendly reply, no retrieval |
| "what is in this doc" | YES | OFF | HyDE → MMR | Hypothetical summary → finds broad chunks → summarizes |
| "what are the risks" | YES | OFF | HyDE → MMR | Hypothetical risk answer → finds risk chunks |
| "what happens if Acme breaches" | YES | ON | Rewrite → MMR + Neo4j | Graph: Acme→breach→consequence + chunks |
| "how are section 3 and 7 related" | YES | ON | Rewrite → MMR + Neo4j | Graph traversal finds shared entity nodes |
| "should I sign this" | YES | ON | Rewrite → MMR + Neo4j | Key clause chunks + obligation graph → LLM advises |

---

### Toggle Button (UI)
- Toggle in chat header — **"Advanced Mode"** ON/OFF
- Default: OFF
- State saved in `localStorage`
- Sent as `X-Advanced-Mode: true/false` header with every chat request

---

### Why LangGraph for Both Paths
- **State machine** — each node has one job, easy to debug
- **Conditional edges** — routing between simple/advanced is explicit
- **Extensible** — Map-Reduce, hybrid search, session memory = just add a node
- **LangChain native** — works directly with ChromaDB/pgvector retrievers

---

### Files to Change
| File | What changes |
|---|---|
| `app/services/rag.py` | Replace `answer_question()` with two LangGraph pipelines: `simple_pipeline()` (HyDE+MMR) and `advanced_pipeline()` (QueryRewrite+MMR+Neo4j). Intent check before both. |
| `app/services/graph_store.py` | New file — Neo4j driver, `build_graph(chunks, session_id)`, `query_graph(question, session_id)` |
| `app/routers/upload.py` | After chunking, call `graph_store.build_graph()` async (doesn't block SSE) |
| `app/routers/chat.py` | Read `X-Advanced-Mode` header → call simple or advanced pipeline |
| `app/static/chat.js` | Add Advanced Mode toggle button, save to localStorage, send as header |
| `app/static/style.css` | Toggle button styles |
| `pyproject.toml` | Add `langgraph`, `neo4j` dependencies |
| `app/config.py` | Add `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `RETRIEVAL_K` |
| `env.example` | Add Neo4j credentials |

### Config
```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io   # AuraDB free tier URI
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
RETRIEVAL_K=3          # chunks returned per MMR query
```

### Failure Cases + Fallback Strategy

**Golden Rule: If anything fails in Advanced Mode → fall back to Simple Mode silently, log the error, show message to user.**

```
Advanced Mode pipeline
        ↓
  Any node fails?
        ↓
       YES
        ↓
Log: [ADVANCED] {node} failed: {error} — falling back to simple pipeline
        ↓
Show user: "Advanced mode unavailable, using standard mode"
        ↓
Run Simple Mode pipeline instead
        ↓
Return answer normally
```

**Specific failure cases:**

| Failure | Where | Fallback | User Message | Log |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intent check fails (Groq down) | Before graph | Default to YES → simple pipeline | none — transparent | `[INTENT] check failed, defaulting to retrieval` |
| Query rewriting fails | Advanced Node 1 | Fall back to simple pipeline (HyDE) | "Advanced mode unavailable, using standard mode" | `[ADVANCED] query rewrite failed: {error}` |
| Neo4j connection down | Advanced Node 2 | Skip graph, use vector only, continue | "Advanced mode unavailable, using standard mode" | `[ADVANCED] Neo4j unavailable: {error}` |
| Neo4j free tier limit hit | Advanced Node 2 | Skip graph, use vector only, continue | "Advanced mode unavailable, using standard mode" | `[ADVANCED] Neo4j limit reached: {error}` |
| BM25 index missing (restart) | Node 2 both paths | Rebuild from ChromaDB chunks on demand | none — transparent | `[BM25] index missing, rebuilding for session={session_id}` |
| Reranker API down | Node 2 both paths | Skip reranking, use RRF top 5 directly | none — transparent | `[RERANK] BGE reranker unavailable, using RRF top 5` |
| Entity extraction fails at ingestion | Upload | Skip graph build, log warning, upload completes | none — upload still works | `[GRAPH] entity extraction failed for {filename}: {error}` |
| Neo4j session mismatch (reuse) | Advanced Node 2 | Copy entities from old session to new session | none — transparent | `[GRAPH] copying entities session={old} → session={new}` |
| Map-Reduce hits Groq rate limit | Phase 7d node | Stop at current batch, summarize what's done | "Partial summary — rate limit reached, try again" | `[MAPREDUCE] rate limit at batch {n}/{total}` |
| HyDE generates wrong query | Simple Node 1 | Use original question as fallback query too | none — transparent | `[HYDE] using original question as fallback query` |

**UI message shown to user (non-blocking toast):**
```
⚠ Advanced mode unavailable — using standard mode
```
Never blocks the answer — user still gets a response, just via simple pipeline.

---

### Negatives to Keep in Mind
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Intent check adds ~200ms always | 1 token call — acceptable, user won't notice |
| Advanced mode: 2 extra LLM calls (rewrite + entity extract at ingest) | Rewrite = ~100 tokens. Entity extract runs at upload time, not query time |
| Neo4j AuraDB free tier — 1 instance only | Fine for dev/demo. Paid tier for production |
| Entity extraction at ingestion adds time | Run async after chunking — doesn't block SSE stream |
| Graph query returns irrelevant entities | Filter by session_id — only entities from uploaded docs |

---

### Phase 7a — Core Pipeline ✅ Done
- Intent check always on — fast Groq model, YES/NO only
- Simple LangGraph path: HyDE (run in parallel with intent) → BM25+MMR+RRF+Rerank → LLM answer
- Advanced Mode toggle in UI (saved to localStorage, sent as `X-Advanced-Mode` header)

### Phase 7b — Advanced Pipeline ✅ Done
- Advanced LangGraph path: Query Rewriting → MMR×3 + Neo4j → merged LLM answer
- Neo4j AuraDB entity extraction at ingestion time (async, doesn't block SSE)
- On any advanced node failure → silent fallback to simple pipeline

### Phase 7c — Hybrid Search + Reranking ✅ Done
Full pipeline for Node 2 (both simple and advanced paths):
```
BM25 (top 7) + Vector MMR (top 7)
      ↓               ↓
      └──── RRF merge (top 7) ────┘
                  ↓
      BAAI/bge-reranker-large
      (HuggingFace Inference API, free tier)
      scores each (question, chunk) pair
                  ↓
              top 5 chunks
                  ↓
            LLM Answer
```
- **BM25** — exact keyword match (clause numbers, dates, amounts, names)
- **Vector MMR** — semantic similarity (meaning-based retrieval)
- **RRF** — merges both by rank position, not score (scale-independent)
- **BGE Reranker** — cross-encoder scores each chunk against question, picks best 5

Config (in `config.yaml`):
```yaml
retrieval:
  hybrid_top_k: 7
  rerank_top_n: 5
  reranker_model: BAAI/bge-reranker-large
```

### Phase 7d — Map-Reduce for Large Docs 📋 Planned
- New LangGraph node: chunks → batches of 10 → LLM summarizes each → combine → final answer
- Auto-triggered when chunk count exceeds threshold (e.g. 50 chunks)

### Phase 7e — Session Memory ✅ Done
- Per-session `_history_store` dict, threadsafe with `threading.Lock()`
- Last 10 turns (20 messages) passed to intent check and every answer node
- "yup", "explain that", "what else?" all resolve correctly using history
- Stored in `app/services/rag.py` — in-memory per server process

---

## Phase 8 — Performance Optimisations ✅ Done

### 8a — Groq Fallback Chain
- Primary: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fast, 500K tokens/day)
- Fallback chain: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` → `llama3-8b-8192` → `gemma2-9b-it` → `llama3-70b-8192`
- Last resort: OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (if `openai_fallback_enabled: true` in config.yaml)
- All models use `max_retries=0` — no 25s SDK waits; our fallback code runs immediately
- Full chain configurable via `config.yaml`, no code changes needed

### 8b — Embedding Batch Optimisation ✅ Updated 2026-06-29
- Old: one `add_texts([chunk])` call per chunk — 40 chunks × 1.3s = 52s
- New: `_add_texts_batched()` — all chunks in batches of 32 → 7.5× faster
- `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE = 32` constant prevents HF API payload/timeout errors
- **2026-06-29 update:** `_add_texts_batched_parallel()` — 3 concurrent batches via `asyncio.Semaphore(3)` + `asyncio.gather`. Batch size raised 32 → 50. 100-chunk doc = 2 parallel batches ≈ 2× faster embedding step.

### 8c — Response Latency (16s → 8-10s)
- **Parallel intent + HyDE** — `ThreadPoolExecutor` runs both simultaneously; HyDE cancelled immediately if intent=NO
- **Fast intent model** — dedicated `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for YES/NO (separate from answer model)
- **Advanced drops HyDE** — advanced mode starts at query-rewrite node, skips HyDE entirely
- **Answer cache** — MD5-keyed in-memory cache (256 entries, scoped per session+question+mode)

### 8d — Non-Blocking Document Parsing ✅ Done 2026-06-29
- **Problem:** `_parser.parse()` (LiteParse, CPU-bound) was called directly in the async event loop — during any PDF upload, all other user requests (chat, other uploads) were stalled until parsing finished.
- **Fix:** `await asyncio.to_thread(_parser.parse, tmp_path)` in `app/services/ingestion.py` — LiteParse runs in the thread pool, event loop stays fully free.
- **Result:** Multiple users can upload and chat simultaneously with no blocking.

---

## Phase 9 — Server Warmup (Zero Cold Starts) ✅ Done 2026-06-29

### Problem
After every server restart, the first user always waited 10–25 seconds extra:
- HF embedding model connection: ~2–5s first call
- BM25 index for default session: ~1–2s first query
- HF reranker connection: ~2–3s first call
- LiteParse models initialised on first PDF parse: ~3–8s

### Design
Four async warmup functions run **in parallel** at startup via `asyncio.gather` — after `_seed_default_session()` completes (BM25 needs the sample doc in the vector store first).

| Function | What it does | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `_warmup_embeddings()` | `embed_query("warmup")` | Validates HF API key + establishes connection |
| `_warmup_bm25()` | `_get_or_build_bm25(default_session)` | BM25 index built in RAM, ready for first user |
| `_warmup_reranker()` | `sentence_similarity("warmup", ...)` | HF InferenceClient connection established |
| `_warmup_parser()` | Parse a minimal dummy PDF | LiteParse internal models fully initialised |

All 4 wrapped in `try/except` — any failure is logged as a warning and never blocks startup.

```
Server starting...
→ _seed_default_session()     ← sample doc seeded (skips if done)
→ _warmup() — 4 tasks in parallel:
      ├── [WARMUP] Embedding model ready
      ├── [WARMUP] BM25 index ready for default session
      ├── [WARMUP] Reranker ready
      └── [WARMUP] LiteParse parser ready
→ "Server is ready to serve requests without cold starts"
```

### Files changed
- `app/main.py` — `_warmup_embeddings`, `_warmup_bm25`, `_warmup_reranker`, `_warmup_parser`, `_warmup()`, updated `lifespan()`

---

## Phase 10 — Clarification & Intelligence (Thinking Mode) ✅ Done 2026-06-29

### Problem
When a user uploads two documents (e.g. two case files) and asks a vague question like "who is the victim?" or "what happened in 2007?", ARIA picked one document arbitrarily and answered without flagging the ambiguity. No mechanism existed to ask the user for clarification.

### Design — Why Not Trust the LLM Alone
If the LLM decides when to clarify, it over-asks — triggering on clear questions, asking twice, and annoying users. Solution: two hard **code-level gates** must pass before the LLM even sees the `clarify()` option in its prompt.

### 10a — Session Clarification Flag

```python
_clarif_store: dict[str, bool] = {}   # session_id → True if asked this turn
_clarif_lock  = threading.Lock()

def _clarif_was_asked(session_id: str) -> bool: ...
def _clarif_set(session_id: str, value: bool): ...
```

### 10b — Two Code-Level Gates (run before ReAct call)

**Gate 1 — Multi-source check:**
```python
sample_docs   = _hybrid_retrieve(vectorstore, session_id, [question])
distinct_sources = {d.metadata.get("source", "") for d in sample_docs if d.metadata.get("source")}
multi_source  = len(distinct_sources) >= 2
```
Only possible when 2+ different documents exist in the retrieved results.

**Gate 2 — Already-clarified flag:**
```python
already_clarified = _clarif_was_asked(session_id)
```
If ARIA asked a clarification last turn, the flag is True → blocked.

```python
clarify_allowed = multi_source and not already_clarified
_clarif_set(session_id, False)   # reset before new turn
```

If `clarify_allowed=False` → `clarify()` is never shown in the ReAct prompt. LLM has no way to use it.

### 10c — Clarify as a Terminal ReAct Action

`Clarify` is NOT a LangChain Tool object — it is a plain text action in the custom ReAct parser, same as `vector_search`. This keeps it outside the LangChain ToolExecutor machinery.

When the agent outputs `Action: clarify(question)`:
```python
if clarify_allowed and action_line.lower().startswith("clarify"):
    clarification_q = action_line[len("clarify"):].strip().strip("()\"\' ")
    _clarif_set(session_id, True)
    return clarification_q, elapsed_ms, []   # terminates loop immediately
```

Terminates the ReAct loop — same behaviour as `Final Answer`. The clarification question is returned as the assistant response and saved to history so the follow-up turn has full context.

### 10d — Ruled Out Approaches

| Approach | Why dropped |
|---|---|
| Pre-check function `_check_ambiguity()` before ReAct | Extra LLM call even when not needed — gates do this at zero LLM cost |
| Word-count gate (skip clarify for short queries) | "who is the victim?" = 4 words and IS ambiguous — count is useless signal |
| Standard mode clarification | Standard mode is for speed. Complex multi-doc ambiguity warrants Thinking Mode |
| LangChain Tool object for `Clarify` | ReAct loop is a custom text parser (not AgentExecutor) — Tool binding not needed |

### 10e — Correction & Frustration Handling

Rules added to `_ARIA_SYSTEM` (system prompt), no separate detection function:

1. If user says previous answer was wrong → re-read history, re-search, correct yourself
2. If you were wrong → acknowledge once clearly, do not repeat the apology
3. If user is rude but your answer was factually correct → stay calm, do not apologise, clarify what the documents say
4. Never apologise more than once per mistake
5. If user asks something unrelated to uploaded documents → politely redirect

**Why system prompt only, not a separate detector:** The ReAct agent already receives full conversation history. It has all the information to reason about whether its previous answer was correct — an extra LLM call would add latency for no benefit.

### Files changed
- `app/services/rag.py`
  - `_ARIA_SYSTEM` — added correction + apology rules block
  - `_clarif_store`, `_clarif_lock`, `_clarif_was_asked()`, `_clarif_set()`
  - `_react_answer()` — `clarify_allowed` parameter, `clarify` action parser (terminal), conditional Rules section
  - `answer_question()` — Gate 1 + Gate 2 checks before `_react_answer()`
- `tests/test_clarification.py` — 26 new tests across 8 test classes

## Phase 11 — Future Enhancements 📋 Planned

- **More file types** — CSV, Excel, Markdown, PowerPoint
- **WhatsApp integration** — already started (`app/routers/whatsapp.py`) — needs Twilio webhook setup
